In this blog post, Iâ€™ll take you on my first-time journey into the world of mobile application security through a bizarre yet real app called The Social Nedwork - a niche social media platform where only people named Ned can post. Armed with curiosity, an old iPhone, and minimal prior experience, I discovered vulnerabilities, responsibly disclosed them, and learned an incredible amount along the way.

This adventure started an unassuming Thursday evening when I came home from work to find my family hanging out. I walked through the door to hear my cousin say, "Ned, I've got the app for you!" Confused, I opened the App Store to discover the majesty of the Social Nedwork.

The Nedwork is a Twitter clone who's tagline reads:

> "Are you a Ned who never really felt like you had a place to share your thoughts? Or a non-Ned who felt out of touch with what Neds are talking about? Worry no more! The Social Nedwork is the new revolutionary social app where only Neds can post! You need to be a verified Ned to post, but all users can like, comment, and just generally hang out on the Social Nedwork."

Amused, I registered an account and immeadiately my spidy senses started tingling.
